The current NWAC Website that displays Letters of Intent that have been turned into the League Office does not provide search or filtering functionality.  As such, I created a scraper so that I could generate a CSV file with only those line items that I cared about.  

The code can be adjusted to scrape any sport, but that sport is currently hard-coded in to be Women's Basketball.
